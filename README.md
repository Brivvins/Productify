# Product Store Application

This is a basic **Product Store** application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It demonstrates the essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it a useful tool for understanding the workflow and structure of a full-stack application.
